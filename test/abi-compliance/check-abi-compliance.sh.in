# Script to check whether the ABI is still intact.

# The base ABI (for version <x>.<y>.0) is kept in libunity-scopes_<x>.<y>.0.abi.xml.gz.
# If the micro version is non-zero, we run abidiff to compare the two versions.
# If there are any complaints, we print an error message ane return non-zero status.
