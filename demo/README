Leaf scopes in this demo:

- scope-A: returns 1 result
- scope-C: returns 3 results
- scope-D: returns 4 results
- scope-N: minimal no-op scope that illustrates the simplest possible implementation
- scope-S: slow scope; returns 1 result after 20 seconds

Aggregating scopes:

- scope-B aggregates from scope-C and scope-D, so it returns 7 results

Processes:

The scopes run as separate process, except for scope-B and scope-C, which run collocated in a single process.

To start the registry, which automatically starts the processes, run

$ ../scoperegistry/scoperegistry Runtime.ini

You do not need to run the registry from the current directory. Just adjust the path to Runtime.ini to point at the Runtime.ini file in *this* directory.

Note that, for testing purposes, you may want to run a scope without having to configure a registry.
See the stand-alone directory for details.

To send a query to a scope, run

$ ./scopes-client <scope-id> <query-string>

For example:

$ ./scopes-client scope-B testquery

The client currently looks for Runtime.ini in the current directory and if not present, uses the system-wide Runtime.ini
shipped with libunity-scopes (/usr/share/unity-scopes-api/Runtime.ini by default)
