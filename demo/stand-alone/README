This is a very simple demo to show how, for testing purposes, you can run a scope without adding the scope
to the registry.

The Runtime.ini file does *not* define where to find the registry. Calling Runtime::registry() throws a
ConfigException in this case.

To reach the scope, the client uses a stringified proxy and calls Runtime::string_to_proxy() to turn
the string back into a scope proxy.

To run this demo (from the build/demo/stand-alone directory):

In one terminal:

    $ ../../scoperunner/scoperunner Runtime.ini ../scopes/scope-A/scope-A.ini

in another terminal:

    $ ./stand-alone-client
