Release Notes for unity-scopes-api
==================================

Changes in version 0.3.1
========================
- The 'Handled' state was remvoed from ActivationResponse::Status and two new
  values were added instead: ShowDash and HideDash.
- Preview action activation method was changed to support widget identifier
  along with action id and hints. Widget identifier parameter is now required by
  Scope::activate_preview_action() and ScopeBase::activate_preview_action()
  methods.

Changes in version 0.3.0
========================
- Preliminary API for filters has been added via OptionSelectorFilter and
  FilterState classes. This part of the API is not yet supported by Unity shell
  and should be considered highly experimental. 
- ScopeBase::create_query() method now takes Query object instance instead of
  just a search query string. Search query string is now encapsulated in the
  Query class and can be retrieved via Query::query_string().
- ScopeProxy class provides overloaded create_query methods for passing filter
  state and department id. Note: departments are not yet supported across the
  API.
