Release Notes for unity-scopes-api
==================================

Changes in version 0.3.1
========================
- Result::activation_scope_name() method was renamed to activation_scope() and
  it now returns ScopeProxy instead of a string. Client code can now use that
  proxy for result activation or preview calls, instead of having to do an extra
  registry lookup.

Changes in version 0.3.0
========================
- Preliminary API for filters has been added via OptionSelectorFilter and
  FilterState classes. This part of the API is not yet supported by Unity shell
  and should be considered highly experimental. 
- ScopeBase::create_query() method now takes Query object instance instead of
  just a search query string. Search query string is now encapsulated in the
  Query class and can be retrieved via Query::query_string().
- ScopeProxy class provides overloaded create_query methods for passing filter
  state and department id. Note: departments are not yet supported across the
  API.
