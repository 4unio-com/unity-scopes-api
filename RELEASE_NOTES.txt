Release Notes for unity-scopes-api
==================================

Changes in version 0.3.1
========================
- Annotation API changes: annotations of 'Card' type were removed and Annotation
  doesn't support category attribute anymore. SearchReply::push() method for
  annotations was renamed to register_annotation(). Annotations are now going to
  be displayed in the order they were registered by scopes.

Changes in version 0.3.0
========================
- Preliminary API for filters has been added via OptionSelectorFilter and
  FilterState classes. This part of the API is not yet supported by Unity shell
  and should be considered highly experimental. 
- ScopeBase::create_query() method now takes Query object instance instead of
  just a search query string. Search query string is now encapsulated in the
  Query class and can be retrieved via Query::query_string().
- ScopeProxy class provides overloaded create_query methods for passing filter
  state and department id. Note: departments are not yet supported across the
  API.
