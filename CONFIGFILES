This document outlines how the scopes run time is configured.
In general, if a recognized key is not set in a configuration
file, a default value applies as detailed below.

The following configuration files are used by the scopes run time:

Runtime.ini
-----------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Runtime.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Runtime].

The following keys are recognized:

- Registry.Identity (string)

  The identity of the local registry. If not set, the default value is "Registry".
  To run a scope without a registry, for example, using the scoperunner for testing, the identity
  can be the empty string.

- Registry.ConfigFile (string)

  The path to the registry configuration file. The default value is
  "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Registry.ini".

- Default.Middleware (string)

  The middleware to be used by default. The default value is "Zmq".

- <middleware>.ConfigFile

  The path to the configuration file for the middleware, with the value of
  Default.Middleware substituted for <middleware>, For example,

  Zmq.ConfigFile = <path>

  The default value is "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Zmq.ini".

- Reap.Expiry

  A ReplyBase instance receives push() invocations from a scope in
  response to a query.
  If a scope becomes non-responsive and stops pushing, eventually,
  the scopes run time calls the finished() method with an error indicating
  that there was no activity for some time and then deallocates the
  ReplyBase instance.

  Reap.Expiry sets the inactivity time (in seconds) for a query to be
  considered "dead". If no push() or finished() message arrives for
  this amount of time, the scopes run time reaps the ReplyBase.

  The default value is 45 seconds.

- Reap.Interval

  The run time maintains a reaper thread that checks for "dead"
  queries (at most) every Reap.Interval seconds. For a Reap.Expiry
  time of 45 seconds and a Reap.Interval of 10 seconds, the actual
  time for a dead query to be reaped is at least 45 seconds and
  at most 55 seconds. that is, Reap.Interval determines how

  The default value is 10 seconds.

Zmq.ini
-------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Zmq.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Zmq].

The following keys are recognized:

- EndpointDir (string)

  The directory in which the public endpoint of a scope (or the registry) is created.
  This endpoint must be accessible to any process.

  The default value is "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zmq". If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not
  set, initialization fails.

  Private endpoints are created in "<EndpointDir.Public>/priv".

Registry.ini
------------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Registry.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Registry].

The following keys are recognized:

- Middleware

  The middleware used by the registry, such as "Zmq". The default value is "Zmq".

- <Middleware>.ConfigFile

  <Middleware> must match the value of the Middleware key, for example:

      Zmq.Middleware = path/to/SomeFile.ini

- Scoperunner.Path

  The path to the scoperunner executable. The path must be an absolute path.
  The default value is "/usr/lib/<arch>/scoperunner".

- Scope.InstallDir

  The directory in which to look for subdirectories containing scope .so and .ini files.
  The default value is "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes".

- OEM.InstallDir

  The directory in which to look for subdirectories containing scope .so and .ini files added
  by OEMs. The default value is "/custom/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes".

- Click.InstallDir

  The directory in which to look for subdirectories containing scopes installed from click packages.
  The default value is "$HOME/.local/share/unity-scopes".

- SS.Registry.Identity

  The identity of the smartscopes registry object. The default value is "SSRegistry".

<scope_id>.ini
--------------

The recognized groups in this file are:

- ScopeConfig
- Appearance

The following keys are recognized in the ScopeConfig group:

- Override

  Determines whether an OEM scope is allowed to override a Canonical scope. This key is used only by Canonical
  scopes. If true, the Canonical scope can be replaced by an OEM scope with the same ID. The default value
  is false.

  For OEM scopes and click scopes, the setting of this key is ignored.

- DisplayName

  The display name of a scope (mandatory, localizable).

- Description

  The description of a scope (mandatory, localizable).

- Author

  The author of the scope (mandatory).

- Art

- Icon

  The icon to be shown for the scope. The default value is the empty string.

- SearchHint

  A search hint for on-screen display (localizable). The default value is the empty string.

- HotKey

  The hot key for the scope. The default value is the empty string.

- Invisible

  Whether the scope is hidden in the UI. The default value is false.

- ScopeRunner

  The path to a custom scoperunner binary. If not set, the default scoperunner is used.

The following keys are recognized in the Appearance group:
