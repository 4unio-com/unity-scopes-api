This document outlines how the scopes run time is configured.
In general, if a recognized key is not set in a configuration
file, a default value applies as detailed below.

The following configuration files are used by the scopes run time:

Runtime.ini
-----------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@SCOPES_DEFAULT_CONFIGDIR@/Runtime.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Runtime].

The following keys are recognized:

- Registry.Identity (string)

  The identity of the local registry. If not set, the default value is "Registry".
  To run a scope without a registry, for example, using the scoperunner for testing, the identity
  can be the empty string.

- Registry.ConfigFile (string)

  The path to the registry configuration file. The default value is
  "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@SCOPES_DEFAULT_CONFIGDIR@/Registry.ini".

- Default.Middleware (string)

  The middleware to be used by default. The default value is "Zmq".

- <middleware>.ConfigFile

  The path to the configuration file for the middleware, with the value of
  Default.Middleware substituted for <middleware>, For example,

  Zmq.ConfigFile = <path>

  The default value is "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@SCOPES_DEFAULT_CONFIGDIR@/Zmq.ini".

Zmq.ini
-------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@SCOPES_DEFAULT_CONFIGDIR@/Zmq.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Zmq].

The following keys are recognized:

- EndpointDir.Public (string)

  The directory in which the public endpoint of a scope (or the registry) is created.
  This endpoint must be accessible to any process.

  The default value is "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<effective UID>/zmq". If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not
  set, "/run/user/<effective UID>/zmq" is used.

- EndpointDir.Private (string)

  The directory in which the private endpoint a scope is created. This endpoint must
  be accessible only to the Dash and the registry. The default value is
  "<EndpointDir.Public>/priv".

Registry.ini

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@SCOPES_DEFAULT_CONFIGDIR@/Registry.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Registry].

The following keys are recognized:

- Middleware

  The middleware used by the registry, such as "Zmq". The default value is "Zmq".

- <Middleware>.ConfigFile
