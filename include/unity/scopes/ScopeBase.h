/**
\file ScopeBase.h
\class ScopeBase
\brief Base class for a scope implementation.

Scopes are accessed by the scopes run time as a shared library (one library per scope).
Each scope must implement a class that derives from ScopeBase, for example:

~~~
#include <unity/scopes/ScopeBase.h>

class MyScope : public unity::scopes::ScopeBase
{
public:
    MyScope();
    virtual ~MyScope();

    virtual void start(std::string const& scope_id);   // Optional
    virtual void stop();                               // Optional
    virtual void run();                                // Optional
    // ...
};
~~~

The derived class gets passed an instance of RegistryProxy in the virtual method
start(), so aggregating scopes need to override the default implementation.
In addition, the library must provide two functions with "C" linkage:
 - a create function that must return a pointer to the derived instance
 - a destroy function that is passed the pointer returned by the create function

Typically, the create and destroy functions will simply call `new` and `delete`, respectively. (However,
there is no requirement that the derived class instance must be heap-allocated.)
If the create function throws an exception, the destroy function will not be called. If the create function returns
NULL, the destroy function _will_ be called with NULL as its argument.

Rather than hard-coding the names of the functions, use the #UNITY_SCOPE_CREATE_FUNCTION and
#UNITY_SCOPE_DESTROY_FUNCTION macros, for example:

~~~
unity::scopes::ScopeBase*
UNITY_SCOPE_CREATE_FUNCTION()
{
    return new MyScope; // Example only, heap-allocation is not mandatory
}

void
UNITY_SCOPE_DESTROY_FUNCTION(unity::scopes::ScopeBase* scope)
{
    delete scope;       // Example only, heap-allocation is not mandatory
}
~~~

After the scopes run time has obtained a pointer to the class instance from the create function, it calls start(),
which allows the scope to intialize itself. This is followed by a call to run(). The call to run() is made by
a separate thread; its only purpose is to pass a thread of control to the scope, for example, to run an event loop.
When the scope should complete its activities, the run time calls stop(). The calls to the create function, start(),
stop(), and the destroy function) are made by the same thread.

The scope implementation, if it does not return from run(), is expected to return from run() in response to a
call to stop() in a timely manner.
