\brief Abstract base class to receive the results of a query.
TODO: fix doc
The scope application code must instantiate a class derived from ListenerBase and pass that instance as
a parameter to the Scope::query() method. Once a query is sent, the scopes run time repeatedly
invokes the push() method, once for each result returned by the query. Once a query is complete,
the finished() method is called once, to inform the caller that the query is complete.

Calls to push() and finished() are made by an arbitrary thread.
