  * Use lowercased build type.
  * Use the macro version of noncopyable.

    https://code.launchpad.net/~michihenning/unity-api/what-
    fix/+merge/198871.

unity-scopes-api (0.1.3+14.04.20131211-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Bump version because of the ResultItem rename.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Added Result::metadata() getter. Create null Variant with default ctor.
  * Introduced a base Result class which carries base result attributes
    and CategorisedResult class that carries Result + a category and
    replaces existing ResultItem class. Provide methods to store a
    Result inside a Result. Changed the internal structure of serialized
    Result to use "attrs" and "internal" dicts inside the outer dict.

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * This fixes a race condition that could cause the thread pool
    accessor on the middleware to return nullptr.

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Add a simple API to launch a scope without going through the dlopen
    based scope runner for the benefit of language bindings.

unity-scopes-api (0.1.1+14.04.20131204-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Prepare for PPA release
  * Added upstart job for the scope registry.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Added CategoryRenderer class that encapsulates a json string with
    actual category template.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Make the option for -Werror apply to plain C too.

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Added scope metadata to config and registry. Optional fields that
    are not set throw on an attempt to access them. This allows us to
    distinguish "not set all" from "set to default value". Simplified
    configuration. Factory.ini no longer exists. Client can now run
    without Runtime.ini, but still needs Registry.ini and Zmq.ini. (It
    looks for those in the current directory.) Will fix this next.
    Various minor clean-up in tests and doc comments.
  * Made it optional for client to specify a name, so multiple clients
    can run concurrently without stepping on each other. Removed no-
    longer-needed source file I should have removed in previous commit.

unity-scopes-api (0.1+14.04.20131127-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Initial release
  * Improved notes in INSTALL file.
  * Fixed scoperegistry to use new scoperunner and to figure out which
    scopes to run from config files. Still to do: deal with overrides
    and OEM scopes, particularly the grouping aspect. SignalThread needs
    to invoke a callback for clean shut-down on receipt of SIGINT.
  * Added reason for why a call to finished() is made (finished,
    cancelled, or error). Fixed incorrect return value from push() after
    cancellation. Lots of doc fixes and other minor tidy-up.
  * Made proxies properly polymorphic, so they derived from a common
    base and no longer redudantly store the pimpl and the MWProxy at
    each level of the hierarchy.

  [ ≈Åukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Automatic snapshot from revision 52 (bootstrap)
  * Format should be 1.0, not sure why I switched it invalidly
  * Re-copyright sources to fit the LGPL-3 license. It's good to have
    all sources in one license to avoid confusion - and I guess LGPL-3
    was supposed to be the main one. Also, I guess Lzmqnse is a typo of
    License, yes?.

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Added requires for libunity-api to the pc file, so that linking
    works properly when using unity exceptions.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Implemented support for categories. Added double and array support
    to the Variant class.
  * Added support for null Variant.
  * Renamed ReplyBase to ReceiverBase. Pass ResultItem by value to
    ReceiverBase::push.
  * First cut at scopes tutorial. Moved move ctor and move assignment
    operator of ResultItem from the header file to .cpp to avoid ABI
    issues in the future. Renamed 'icon' to 'art' in ResultItem.
  * Added category setter to ResultItem.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Merged capnp fixes.
  * Quote quotes.
  * Use unique_ptrs for holding impl objects instead of shared_ptrs
    where possible.
  * Clang usability fixes.

  [ Ubuntu daily release ]
  * Automatic snapshot from revision 71
