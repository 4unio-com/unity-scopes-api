unity-scopes-api (0.1+14.04.20131127-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Initial release
  * Improved notes in INSTALL file.
  * Fixed scoperegistry to use new scoperunner and to figure out which
    scopes to run from config files. Still to do: deal with overrides
    and OEM scopes, particularly the grouping aspect. SignalThread needs
    to invoke a callback for clean shut-down on receipt of SIGINT.
  * Added reason for why a call to finished() is made (finished,
    cancelled, or error). Fixed incorrect return value from push() after
    cancellation. Lots of doc fixes and other minor tidy-up.
  * Made proxies properly polymorphic, so they derived from a common
    base and no longer redudantly store the pimpl and the MWProxy at
    each level of the hierarchy.

  [ ≈Åukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Automatic snapshot from revision 52 (bootstrap)
  * Format should be 1.0, not sure why I switched it invalidly
  * Re-copyright sources to fit the LGPL-3 license. It's good to have
    all sources in one license to avoid confusion - and I guess LGPL-3
    was supposed to be the main one. Also, I guess Lzmqnse is a typo of
    License, yes?.

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Added requires for libunity-api to the pc file, so that linking
    works properly when using unity exceptions.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Implemented support for categories. Added double and array support
    to the Variant class.
  * Added support for null Variant.
  * Renamed ReplyBase to ReceiverBase. Pass ResultItem by value to
    ReceiverBase::push.
  * First cut at scopes tutorial. Moved move ctor and move assignment
    operator of ResultItem from the header file to .cpp to avoid ABI
    issues in the future. Renamed 'icon' to 'art' in ResultItem.
  * Added category setter to ResultItem.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Merged capnp fixes.
  * Quote quotes.
  * Use unique_ptrs for holding impl objects instead of shared_ptrs
    where possible.
  * Clang usability fixes.

  [ Ubuntu daily release ]
  * Automatic snapshot from revision 71
