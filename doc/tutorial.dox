\page tutorial Tutorial

This short tutorial covers the basic steps and building blocks needed for implementing your own scope with unity-scopes-api, using C++. For complete examples
of various scopes see demo/scopes subdirectory.

\section simplescope A simple scope which doesn't query other scopes.

This is the typical case: a scope that connects to a remote or local backend, database etc. and provides results in response to search queries coming from a
client (i.e. Unity Dash or another scope).

\subsection scopebase Create a scope class that implements ScopeBase inteface.

There are a few pure virtual methods that need to be implemented; at the very minimum you need to provide a non-empty implementation of
\link unity::scopes::ScopeBase::start() start\endlink and \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase::create_query() create_query\endlink methods. 

\code{.cpp}
class MyScope: public unity::scopes::ScopeBase
{
public:
    virtual int start(std::string const&, unity::scopes::RegistryProxy const&) override;
    virtual void stop() override;
    virtual void run() override;
    virtual unity::scopes::QueryBase::UPtr create_query(std::string const& query, unity::scopes::VariantMap const&) override;
    virtual unity::scopes::QueryBase::UPtr preview(unity::scopes::Result const&, unity::scopes::VariantMap const&) override;
}
\endcode

The \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase::start() start\endlink method must, at the very least return ScopeBase::VERSION, e.g.

\code{.cpp}
int MyScope::start(string const&, unity::scopes::RegistryProxy const&)
{
    return ScopeBase::VERSION;
}
\endcode

The \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase::stop() stop\endlink method should release any resources, such as network connections where applicable. See the
documentation of \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase ScopeBase\endlink for an explanation of when \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase::run() ScopeBase::run\endlink;
is useful; for typical and simple cases the implementation of run can be an empty function.

The \link unity::scopes::SearchQuery::create_query() create_query\endlink method of scope implementation is the entry point of every search - it receives
search queries from the Dash or other scopes. This method must return an instance of an object that implements
\link unity::scopes::SearchQuery SearchQuery\endlink interface, e.g:

\code{.cpp}
QueryBase::UPtr MyScope::create_query(string const& query, VariantMap const&)
{
    QueryBase::UPtr q(new MyQuery(query));
    return q;
}
\endcode

\subsection querybase Create a query class that implements QueryBase interface.

The central and most important method that needs to be implemented in this interface is \link unity::scopes::SearchQuery run\endlink.
This is where actual processing of current search query takes place, and this is the spot where you may want to query local or remote data source for results
matching the query.

The \link unity::scopes::SearchQuery run\endlink method gets passed an instance of SearchReplyProxy, which represents a receiver of query results. Please note
that SearchReplyProxy is just a shared pointer for \link unity::scopes::SearchReply SearchReply\endlink object. The two most important
methods of SearchReply object that every scope have to use are \link unity::scopes::SearchReply::register_category register_category\endlink
and \link unity::scopes::SearchReply::push push\endlink.

The \link unity::scopes::SearchReply::register_category register_category\endlink method is a factory method for creating new categories (see
\link unity::scopes::Category\endlink). Categories can be created at any point during query processing inside run method, but it's recommended to create
them as soon as possible (ideally as soon as they are known to the scope).

Registering a category has the following effects:
- it immediately allocates a space for it in the Dash (unless the client of this
  scope is another scope).
- it constitutes the order of categories in the Dash (they appear in the order
  they were registered).
- a space for registered category is removed (collapsed) by the Dash if category
  turns out to be empty at the end of the search.

When creating a category, one of its parameters is a \link unity::scopes::CategoryRenderer \endlink instance,
which specifies how will a particular category be rendered. See the unity::scopes::CategoryRenderer documentation for more on that subject.

The actual search results have to be wrapped inside \link unity::scopes::CategorisedResult CategorisedResult\endlink objects and
passed to \link unity::scopes::SearchReply::push push\endlink.

A typical implementation of run may look like this:

\code{.cpp}
void MyQuery::run(SearchReplyProxy const& reply)
{
    auto category = reply->register_category("recommended", "Recommended", icon);
    //... query a local or remote backend

    for (auto res: backend.get_results(search_query)) // for every result returned by a backend
    {
        ...
        CategorisedResult result(category); // create a result item in "recommended" category
        result.set_uri(...);
        result.set_title(...);
        result.set_art(...);
        result.set_dnd_uri(...);
        result["my-custom-attribute"] = Variant(...); // add arbitrary data as needed

        reply->push(result); // send result to the client
    }
}
\endcode

\subsection export Export the scope.

The scope needs to be compiled into a .so shared library and to be succesfully
loaded at runtime it must provide two C functions to create and destroy it - a
typical code snippet to do this looks as follows:

\code{.cpp}
extern "C" {
    EXPORT unity::scopes::ScopeBase* UNITY_SCOPE_CREATE_FUNCTION()
    {
        return new MyScope();
    }

    EXPORT void UNITY_SCOPE_DESTROY_FUNCTION(unity::scopes::ScopeBase* scope_base)
    {
        delete scope_base;
    }
}
\endcode

\section aggscope A simple aggregator scope which combines results from other scopes.

Aggregator scope is not much different from regular scopes, except for its data sources can include any other scope(s). The main difference is in the
implementation of run method of \link unity::scopes::SearchQuery SearchQuery\endlink and in the new class that has to implement
\link unity::scopes::SearchListener SearchListener\endlink interface, which receives result from other scope(s).

\subsection subquery Query another scopes via SearchQuery::create_subquery()

To send search query to another scope, use \link unity::scope::SearchQuery create_subquery\endlink inside your implementation of SearchQuery.
This method requires - among search query string - an instance of \link unity::scopes::ScopeProxy ScopeProxy\endlink that points to the target scope and an instance of class that implements
\link unity::scopes::SearchListener SearchListener\endlink interface. ScopeProxy can be obtained from unity::scopes::RegistryProxy and the right place to
do this is in the implementation of \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase::start() start()\endlink method of \link unity::scopes::ScopeBase ScopeBase\endlink interface.

\code{.cpp}

int MyScope::start(std::string const&, unity::scopes::RegistryProxy const& registry)
{
    try
    {
        scope_to_query_ = registry->find("scope-A"); // store the proxy for passing it further in create_query
    }
    catch (NotFoundException const& e)
    {
        ...
    }
    return VERSION;
}

unity::scopes::QueryBase::UPtr MyScope::create_query(std::string const& query, unity::scopes::VariantMap const&)
{
    QueryBase::UPtr q(new MyQuery(query, scope_to_query_));
    return q;
}

...

void MyQuery::run(unity::scopes::SearchReplyProxy const& upstream_reply) 
{
    auto category = reply->register_category("recommended", "Recommended", icon, "");
    SearchListener::SPtr reply(new MyReceiver(upstream_reply, category));
    create_subquery(scope_to_query_, query_, VariantMap(), reply);
    ...
}
\endcode

\subsection receiver Create a class that implements SearchListener interface

The \link unity::scopes::SearchListener SearchListener\endlink is an abstract class to receive the results of a query sent to a scope. Its virtual push methods let the
implementation receive \link unity::scopes::SearchListener::push result items and categories\endlink returned by that query. A simple implementation of
an aggregator scope may just register all categories it receives and push all received results upstream to the query originator, e.g.

\code{.cpp}

virtual void push(Category::SCPtr category) override
{
    upstream_->register_category(category);
}

void MyReceiver::push(ResultItem result)
{
    upstream_->push(std::move(result));
}
\endcode

A more sophisticated aggregator scope can rearrange results it receives into a different set of categories, alter or enrich the results before pushing them
upstream etc.
